Getting back from San Diego and talking with every one of 
our folks who were at the UC this year, we all feel like this was 
one of our best conferences in years. It seemed like Esri took 
a lot of the feedback that we offered last year into account 
and made a huge effort to incorporate changes to make it a 
successful conference for all involved.  We absolutely LOVED 
that you brought back the industry showcases and that we 
were able to work in such close to proximity to the Public 
Safety team.  It was so much more efficient and convenient 
for the clients as well as BCS and Esri to be able to easily walk 
across the aisle to show solutions.
